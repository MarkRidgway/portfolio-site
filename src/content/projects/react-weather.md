A React application showing the current weather and week forecast of a given location. This application uses the Google Geocode API to get information about a zip code as well as the Dark Sky API for weather data. A node application running on Firebase Functions was created to work with the Dark Sky API due to CORS restrictions. More features will be added to this project in the future.
