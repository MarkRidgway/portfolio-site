A cross platform application written in **Angular 4** &amp; **Ionic 3** that is for managing kid's game accounts by parents. The project involved desiging and modifying an API and working with designers to build the Angular web application. This web application also has native ios and Android versions and is used by thousands of users daily.

This was a challening project that took a few months and was a great learning experience.
